# Free-Music-Archive-Music-Analysis-Genre-Prediction-and-Song-Recommendations

Project Description:
Innovative companies like Spotify and Shazam leverage music data in a very clever way to provide
amazing services to their users. They use recommendation algorithms and automatic genre
classification which greatly contributes to increasing user experience. From this project, we aim
to perform such tasks of genre classification and music recommendation when musical features
are provided. We basically aim to create a music recommender system and a playlist generator for
companies like Spotify and Pandora.
Inference of musical genre, whilst seemingly innate to the human mind, remains a challenging task
for the machine learning community. We used various machine learning algorithms to achieve our
goal. We made use of classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes
Classifier, Neural Networks and Random Forest Classifier to identify genre of the music track. We
also applied K-means clustering algorithm to create song clusters and recommend a song which
the user is most likely to enjoy.
